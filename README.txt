This website was created to show various algorithms and their implementations on paper, JS, and in Java. 

There is a run button for all algorithms that correponds to the algorithm running client-side on JS, as well as it can be modified so the user can run their own implementation to see if it is correct. There are also Java implementations written as well, however the user will need to copy the method and run that themselves.

The written algorithms are implemented as flowcharts, which can be enlarged by double clicking, and minimized by a single click. The flowchart syntax is consistent with the book Computer Science by Alexandra Forsythe.

Initially the solutions are not displayed for all problems to give the user an opportunity to solve it themselves, however they can toggle the corresponding solution box to see the solution if they'd like.
